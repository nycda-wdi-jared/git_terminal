# [fit] git Basics
<br>
## [fit] See [nycda.com/git](http://nycda.com/git) for a step-by-step guide

---

# Learning Objective

- Understand what `git` is and where it is used

- Make your first, "commit"

---

# Getting Setup

Please download git, if you don't already have it:
[http://git-scm.com/downloads](http://git-scm.com/downloads)

If you are a Windows user, use Git Bash (included with Git) for all Terminal and git interactions. To launch, Start Menu -> Programs -> Git -> Git Bash

---

# Where is git?

- Once you've installed git, you can verify it has been installed by opening up the Terminal and typing `git`

````bash
$ git
````

- If you see a 'command not recognized' error, you probably haven't installed git

- We can solve your issues once the lecture is over - look along with a fellow student for now!

---

# What is `git`?

- A version control system meant to make it easier to have multiple versions of code, sometimes across multiple developers or teams

- At its most simple, `git` helps with the 'indexv1.html, indexv2.html, indexv3FINAL.html' problem

- At its most complex, git allows developers to work together worldwide on code without stepping on each other's toes

---

# Why learn `git`?

- Allows you to see the changes you make to your code and easily revert them

- By pushing your git repositories to GitHub, you'll have a developer portfolio automagically!

- You'll eventually push your code to a remote server using `git` - your application's **host**, so you can release your webpage or web application to the world

---

# Don't get confused - `git` vs GitHub.com

- **git** is a version control system that takes snapshots of your code at certain points in development

- These snapshots are stored in a 'repo', or 'repository' on your local machine

- **GitHub.com** is a website that hosts git repositories on a remote server

- We'll be able to troubleshoot your issues more easily if you're able to identify which of these two separate things you're having trouble with

---

# Configuring git

Your commits will have your name and email attached to them. Before we put anything up in public, let's make sure they're correct!

````bash
$ git config --global user.name
> should be your name, i.e. Zach Feldman
$ git config --global user.email
>should be your email, i.e. zach@nycda.com
````

To fix either, just add the desired value in quotes after the command:

````bash
$ git config --global user.name "Zach Feldman"
$ git config --global user.email "zachfeldman@gmail.com"
````

---

# Getting started

- Before using `git`, you'll need a **project** to use it with

- A **project** is any directory (folder) full of files - this could be a website, web application, or really any collection of files

- Use the `cd` command to get to the directory you'll be using git in

---

# Getting started: `git init`

- Once you're in your project's directory, run the `git init` command to initialize git

````bash
$ git init
````

- You only need to run this command **once** per project

- Unsure if you've initialized yet? Try running `git status` - if you get a `fatal error`, you haven't run `git init` yet

---

# Making your first commit

- A commit is a 'snapshot' of your project at a certain time

- It tracks all of the changes you've made since the last commit

- Two steps to make the commit:

  - **stage** your files: choose which files to commit

  - **commit** tell git to make your commit with an accompanying descriptive message

---

# Staging files

- To stage an individual file, use `git add`

````bash
$ git add index.html
````

- To stage every file/change since your last commit, just use -A or '.'

````bash
$ git add -A
-- OR --
$ git add .
````

---

# Making a commit

- Once your files are staged, you can make a commit using the `git commit` command

- Always use the `-m` flag to add a descriptive commit message

````bash
$ git commit -m "Initial commit."
````

---

# Tip: Use descriptive commit messages

If you use descriptive commit messages, it'll be much easier to see how your project has progressed later on

````bash
$ git commit -m "Initial commit."
````

````bash
$ git commit -m "Added 'about' to the navigation bar and a page for it."
````

````bash
$ git commit -m "Closes #15 by adding a blue background on hover."
````

---
# Tip: If you forget a commit message...

If you forget to add a commit message and hit enter after `git commit`

````bash
$ git commit [Enter]
````

You may end up in what's called vim. To exit this, simply hit the escape key,
then type the following.


````bash
$ :q!
````

---

# `git status`

- You can always run this command 'for free', meaning with no repercussions

- Will help you figure out if

  - `git` is initialized for this project

  - what files are staged

  - what files have been changed since the last commit

---

# Tip: you need files!

- A common beginner mistake is to get excited about starting your new project and try to `git init` before you have any files

- git doesn't work unless you have files to track!

---

# Tip: use `git log`

- Curious what commits have been made so far?

- `git log` will show you what commits have been made so far

````bash
$ git log

# Exercise: Getting to know git

- Create a new project folder with at least two files, perhaps `index.html` and `style.css`

- Initialize a new git repository in this folder

- Make your initial commit

- Make a change to one or both of the files, then make another commit

- Repeat this process starting from scratch a few times to make sure you have it down
